## Theme installation

Download or Fork the bit.app repository. And Put in the Sites folder locally and extract it. Then Run `BUNDLE INSTALL` for installing Ruby Gems. Then start your local server using `Rails Server /  Rails s` and check the theme in the browser using `http://localhost:3000`.

## Important Note

we use local jquery.min  version is (jQuery v2.1.4) in Application.js rather than gem in our theme.
The reason is Rails 5  default jquery is rendered through rails_ujs that is not compaitable for our theme version.
